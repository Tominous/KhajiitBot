## Khajiit Bot (previously GarryBot)
***Khajiit has wares, if you have coin..._***

Khajiit searches G2A and Steam, then compares the prices and returns a embedded message with links to both and a price comparison. Use "!game name of game" to search.

	Currently Khajiit only responds with Global & North American results in USD $. 
		Future additions:
		1. Even more market places to compare prices with.
		2. The ability to choose more regions to search by.
		3. Cool phrases/witty responses when you search.
